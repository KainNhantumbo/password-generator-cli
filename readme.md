# Password Generator CLI (Node.js + Typescript)

This is a **bug tracker application** built with React.JS and Typescript. To be short, the main goal here is to help developers to keep track of the software development bugs and issues, in a simple and more efficient way. You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/KainNhantumbo/bug-tracker-api).

## Scripts for testing

Make sure you have installed **Node.js (v16.15.3 or later recommended) which also comes with npm**.\
In the project directory, you can run in terminal:

```bash
 npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode and the server will reload when you make changes to the source code.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the **dist folder**.

```bash
npm run start
```

Builds and starts the server in prodution.
